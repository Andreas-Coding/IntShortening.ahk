# IntShortening.ahk
## v1.0.1
This library aims to implement a highly modifyable integer shortening into ahk.
The only size limit for handed integers would be on ahk. If you need to pass integers > 2147483647 to be shortened, pass them as string, the shortening methods are able to do that just fine.

Further documentation on how it works could be found within the documentation of the class itself or the example.ahk file.
